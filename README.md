Warshade is a program I created to help automate server backup, transfer, and restoration.

The purpose of this is to achieve rapid response times for whenever my friend and I were constantly upgrading servers. This helped us out enourmously, and cut down installation times by a tremendous amount.

Originally I had written this in Bash, but re-wrote it in Python3 to add a Main Menu, and ease-of-access.
